--- In their search for yield in the current low interest rate environment, many investors have turned to sovereign debt in emerging economies, which has raised concerns about risks to financial stability from these capital flows.

We find that recent increases in foreign holdings of these securities have played a significant role in driving up their liquidity premiums.
