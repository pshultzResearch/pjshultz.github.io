In the U.S. Treasury market, the most recently issued, or so-called “on-the-run,” security typically trades at a price above those of more seasoned but otherwise comparable securities. This difference is known as the on-the-run premium. In this paper, yield spreads between pairs of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) with both matching and nearly-matching maturities but of separate vintages are analyzed. Adjusting for differences in conventional liquidity premiums, values of embedded deflation options, and coupon rates, the results show a small, insignificant premium on recently issued TIPS, which leads us to conclude that there is no on-the-run premium in the TIPS market.
