In recent decades, long-term interest rates around the world have fallen to historic lows.
We examine the source of this decline using a dynamic term structure model of Canadian
nominal and real yields with adjustments for term, liquidity, and inflation risk premiums.
Canada provides a novel perspective on this issue because of its established indexed debt
market, negligible distortions from monetary quantitative easing or the zero lower bound,
and absence of sovereign credit risk. We find that since 2000, the steady-state real interest
rate has fallen by more than 2 percentage points, long-term inflation expectations have
edged down, and real bond and inflation risk premiums have varied over time but shown
little longer-run trend. Therefore, the drop in the equilibrium real rate appears largely to account for the lower new normal in interest rates.
