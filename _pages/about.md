I am a PhD candidate in the Finance Department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests include macrofinance, financial intermediation, and monetary policy. Prior to graduate school I worked as a Research Associate for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and as a Financial Analyst for ICONIQ Capital.
